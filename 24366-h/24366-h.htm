<h2>INTRODUCTORY REMARKS,</h2>

<p class="center">BY THE PUBLISHER.</p>

<p>Among the evils which a vitiated appetite has fastened upon mankind,
those that arise from the use of Tobacco hold a prominent place,
and call loudly for reform. We pity the poor Chinese, who stupifies
body and mind with opium, and the wretched Hindoo, who is under
a similar slavery to his favorite plant, the Betel; but <i>we</i> present the
humiliating spectacle of an enlightened and christian nation, wasting
annually more than twenty-five millions of dollars, and destroying the
health and the lives of thousands, by a practice not at all less degrading
than that of the Chinese or Hindoo.</p>

<p>Whether, then, we consider the folly and indecency of the habit,
or the waste of property, health and life which it occasions, it is time
for the Patriot, the Philanthropist and the Christian, to put forth united,
vigorous and systematic efforts to banish this injurious and disgusting
habit from the community.</p>

<p>It is a fact, that one reform not only prepares the way for another,
but often so depends upon it, that the complete triumph of the one cannot
be effected without that of the other. Such appears to be the relationship
existing between the use of intoxicating drinks and that of
the stimulating narcotic, tobacco. The use of tobacco almost always
accompanies the use of alcoholic drinks, and it may be feared that
total abstinence from the latter will not be <i>permanent</i>, unless there
is also a total abstinence from the former. Our temperance brethren,
particularly our worthy Washingtonians, will do well to bear
this in mind.</p>

<p>The tobacco reform, being similar to that of temperance, must be
brought about by similar means. Information must be diffused, the
evils of the practice exposed, and the attention of the public aroused
to the subject. To aid in this, is the object of the following pamphlet,
two editions of which have already been put in circulation, and it is
said to have been re-published in England. The favorable reception
of the former editions, as shown by the repeated editorial remarks,
and the numerous letters of thanks addressed to the author, affords
much encouragement for a vigorous prosecution of the enterprise.
Three members of the church of which the author is pastor, placed
at his disposal a sum sufficient to supply, gratuitously, each of the
1000 Beneficiaries of the American Education Society, with a copy
of the essay. Orders were furnished for bundles for distribution.
An individual in Maine ordered 500 copies, and 1000 were ordered
by E. C. Delevan, of New York, the distinguished advocate of Temperance.</p>

<p>Let the friends of true reform remember the early days of the temperance
cause, and take courage. All interested should exert themselves.
Clergymen can do much by lecturing and other means.
Churches should form Anti-Tobacco Societies, circulate information<!-- Page 4 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
and induce as many as possible to take a stand against the evil, by
enrolling their names on a <i>Pledge</i>.</p>

<p>Teachers should speak on the subject, and endeavor to prevent
the formation of so vile and tyranical a habit, by those under their
influence; for it is a fact that lads in many of our public schools try
to hasten their claims to <i>manliness</i>, by learning to chew, smoke or
snuff. This being the case, we may expect, of course, to find these
practices prevalent in our academies and colleges, our medical and
our law schools and theological seminaries.</p>

<p>In the early records of Harvard University, says Dr. Mussey, is
a regulation ordering that "no scholar shall take tobacco unless permitted
by the President, with the consent of his parents, on good
reason first given by a physician, and then only in a sober and private
manner." How different now! Probably one half, at least,
of the students of our colleges are, not in a "sober and private
manner," but publicly addicted to this slovenly and disgusting practice.</p>

<p>As the use of tobacco is injurious to health, it is the duty of physicians
to exert their influence against it. Their authority upon such
subjects is generally respected, and is therefore very important.</p>

<p>To the ladies, it would hardly seem necessary to say a word, in order
to secure their aid in a reform that so intimately concerns themselves.
In this matter, as in the vice of intemperance, woman,
though comparatively innocent, is by far the greatest sufferer. With
what a melancholy prospect does a young lady marry a man who
uses the filthy plant in any form. He may <i>at first</i> do it in a neat,
or even a genteel manner, and neutralize the sickening odor by the
most grateful perfumes; but this trouble will soon be dispensed with,
and in all probability he will, at no distant day, become a sloven,
with his garments saturated with smoke, and himself steeped in tobacco
juice. Alas, to think of being annoyed a life-time by the
nauseous odor of the vile tobacco worm, and of wasting patience
and strength in vain endeavors to preserve neatness in his slimy trail!
Little can be accomplished in this, or any other reform, without the
aid of females. Let them take hold of the subject, and exert their
legimate influence, and public opinion will soon be corrected; young
men and old too, will soon learn that by no rule in the code of politeness
and good breeding, can the use of tobacco be tolerated.</p>

<p>A word to dealers. How can a man who regards the morals, the
happiness and the prosperity of his neighborhood and his country,
deal out so useless, so filthy, and so injurious an article as tobacco?
Many will of course, excuse themselves by saying as the rum-sellers
once did, "If I don't sell it, others will," This plea did not justify
the rum-seller, neither will it, the dealer in tobacco. Others will
say, "I <i>must</i> sell it, or I shall offend my patrons and lose their custom."
But this is not valid even as a selfish argument. A large
and increasing portion of the community would be glad to patronize
traders who sell only the useful and necessary articles of life.
Let respectable traders cease to sell the article, and respectable customers
would soon cease to buy it.<!-- Page 5 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>The abominable filthiness of the practice of using tobacco, is a
sufficient argument to induce all decent people to wage war against
it. Stage coaches, rail cars, steamboats, public houses, courts of
justice, halls of legislation, and the temples of God, are all defiled
by the loathsome consumers of this dirty, Indian herb. For the
sake of decency, for the honor of humanity, let the land be purified
from this worse than beastly pollution!</p>

<p>Let none be discouraged from engaging in this reform, because it
relates to a wide-spread and fashionable vice. With a moderate degree
of effort in each town and village, hundreds of thousands might
in one year's time, be induced to pledge themselves against all use
of tobacco.</p>

<p>During the last winter I drew up the following pledge, and obtained
many signatures here and in other parts of the state.</p>

<div class="pledge"><p class="center">ANTI-TOBACCO PLEDGE.</p>

<p style="font-style: italic">We, the subscribers, believing that the use of <span class="smcapnorm">Tobacco</span>, in all its
forms, is injurious to health, and knowing it to be a slovenly, sluttish,
and disgusting habit, do pledge ourselves that we will not <span class="smcapnorm">smoke</span> it,
<span class="smcapnorm">chew</span> it, nor <span class="smcapnorm">snuff</span> it; and that we will use efforts to persuade those
addicted to the practice, to discontinue its use; and above all, that we
will not traffic in it, nor countenance those who do; and that we will
use our influence to banish the "vile stuff" from New England, our
country, and the world.</p></div>

<p>A gentleman in North Bridgewater, to whom I lent a pamphlet on
this subject, said he had not read it half through, before he emptied
his pockets of tobacco, and resolved to use no more. He also
took a pledge to circulate among his neighbors.</p>

<p>Another man who had chewed tobacco thirty-three years, abandoned
the habit and remarked that he would not return to it for fifty
dollars.</p>

<p>Two benevolent individuals, in Providence, had two or three hundred
copies of the above pledge printed to circulate in the State of
Rhode Island. One of the principal clergymen in P. said, a member
of his church, a trader, told him that the money paid for tobacco
in the city was sufficient to support the public preaching. A
gentleman there, who has recently given up tobacco, said he would
not go back to its use for a thousand dollars, although it cost him a
great effort to refrain from it. A young man, after receiving a private
lecture from an anti-tobacco friend, committed to the flames
half a dozen cigars he had by him, and signed the pledge.</p>

<p>I have conversed with very many addicted to the use of tobacco,
and nearly all express regret at having formed the habit.</p>

<p>A few days since in a town not far from Providence, as I was sitting
in the stage about starting for the city, up came a reverend
gentleman, a very fine man by the way, with a big cigar about half
burned. He had too much good breeding to get into the stage with
it, and to all appearance, disliked to part with so good a friend; he<!-- Page 6 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
accordingly stood outside and puffed away like a steamer, at the
same time keeping an eye on the driver; when all was ready, he
scrambled in, and we drove off. What an example, for a clergyman
to stand in a public street and puff a cigar like a loafer or a blackguard!</p>

<p>Rev. Mr. C., in a village adjoining Providence relates, that a
brother clergyman called to preach for him. He was in the habit of
chewing tobacco, and Mr. C. took the opportunity to speak to him
on the subject. At first the brother remarked that there was nothing
wrong or injurious in it; but on Mr. C's pressing the matter and asking
how he could preach "righteousness, temperance" and good
habits in all things, when he was himself addicted to such a practice,
the brother frankly acknowledged that he knew he was setting a bad
example, and that tobacco was poisonous, injurious to health and
shortened life, but he excused himself by saying he <i>could not</i> give
it up, for he found it <i>impossible</i> to write a sermon or preach it with
any success, without taking tobacco. Sermons and preaching inspired
by tobacco! What better is this, than the inspiration of
brandy?</p>

<p>Rev. Mr.&mdash;&mdash;, now of Boston, formerly of a neighboring city,
is a most excessive smoker and chewer, so much so that it was a
matter of notoriety and remark among his congregation and acquaintances
of his former residence. He was a very agreeable
man in other respects, but his study, his library, and every thing
about him were so completely saturated with tobacco smoke, that
the ladies of his church rarely made him a call, and more rarely
borrowed a book from his extensive and excellent library.&mdash;Is it not
time for clergymen to reform themselves in this particular, and then
consistently to set about reforming others.</p>

<p>I have recently learned that many <i>ladies</i> are in the habit of <i>chewing
snuff!</i> Some of them become so addicted to it as to use enormous
quantities in this way. "One of these snuff eaters," I was
told, "was accustomed to take herself by the under lip with one
hand, and with the thumb and four fingers of the other to fill in an
embankment between her lips and teeth." Shocking! Yet, what
young lady who carries a concealed snuff-box, can be sure of not
coming to this?</p>

<p>I saw a woman who commenced with chewing snuff, and is now a
regular tobacco chewer. She said however, that she intended to give
up the habit and refrain from tobacco in all its forms.</p>

<p>Unless something is done to check the evil, who can say that we
shall not become as bad as the inhabitants of Cuba, where, according
to Rev. Mr. Ingersoll, "not only men, but <i>women</i> and <i>children</i>
smoke, and some at a large expense." And according to Rev. Dr.
Abbot, "it was the common estimate that in Havana, there was an
average consumption of <i>ten thousand dollars worth of cigars in a
day</i>."</p>

<h2>RECOMMENDATIONS.</h2>

<h4><i>From the Rochester Observer.</i></h4>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fowler on the Evils of using Tobacco</span>.&mdash;'A disquisition on the evils of
using tobacco, and the necessity of an immediate and entire reform,' by Rev. Orin
Fowler, of Fall River, Mass. This is a very valuable and instructive discourse.
We have for two years or more been fully convinced that the use of tobacco, in its
three common forms, ought immediately to be abandoned; but never were we so
fully sensible of the alarming extent and tremendous ravages of this evil, as when
we had read this production. We think no <i>christian</i>, who is willing to know and
do his duty, can read this pamphlet, without saying on the spot, if he uses tobacco,
(except it be judiciously prescribed by a physician.) the use of this poisonous, deleterious
weed is a <i>grievous sin</i>, and I will abandon it <i>immediately and forever</i>.</p>

<p>Mr. F. lays down the position that it is the duty of every man and woman to abstain
immediately, entirely and forever, from all use of tobacco, whether by chewing,
smoking or snuffing, except it be as a medicine.</p>

<p>In favor of this point he offers the following arguments, which we think he has
fully sustained, by well attested facts, quotations from approved authors, and the
deductions of sound reasoning.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The history of this loathsome weed. It has ever since its discovery been
considered exceedingly injurious, and its general use opposed by judicious men.</p>

<p>2. Its ruinous effect upon the health and constitution of men.</p>

<p>3. Its ruinous effects upon the intellect.</p>

<p>4. Its ruinous effects upon public and private morals.</p>

<p>5. The amazing waste of property which its use involves.</p>

<p>6. The mortality which its use occasions.</p>

<p>7. The apologies made by the lovers of tobacco.</p>

<p>8. The eternal ruin which tobacco occasions.</p>

</div>

<p>We intend in our next to give extracts from this discourse. We hope it will
have a wide circulation, and would commend it to the careful perusal of all christians,
especially to ministers, who use this vile and ruinous plant."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>Edward C. Delevan, Secretary of the New York State Temperance Society, says,
in a letter just received&mdash;"The subject of your Essay is one of immense importance
to the world and to the temperance cause. The use of this vile weed has
been the medium of forming the appetite for strong drink, and ultimately destroying
thousands of the most promising youth of our country. You will hardly ever
meet with an intemperate person without finding him addicted to the use of tobacco.
The public only want light on this important subject, to act. Your able and
convincing Disquisition will be the means of doing much good. I hope funds will
be provided to furnish a copy to each clergyman in the United States. Send me
one thousand copies of the second edition, as soon as it is from the press."</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p class="nobot">"<span class="smcap">Fowler on the Evils of using Tobacco</span>.&mdash;We are anxious to see this work
extensively circulated, for we are confident that it will do good. The pamphlet
contains much valuable information, and will be found well worth an attentive and
frequent perusal."</p>
<p class="rightsig"><i>The Unionist</i>, Brooklyn, Conn.</p>

<hr class="minor" />

<p>"<span class="smcap">Fowler on the Evils of using Tobacco</span>.&mdash;The subject of which this pamphlet
treats is one which, we are persuaded, has received too small a share of attention
from those who are laboring to free our land, utterly and forever, from the
thraldom of intemperance. From our own observation, limited as it has been, we
are persuaded that the victims of intemperance in the use of this poisonous weed
are by no means inconsiderable in number. Probably Mr. Fowler is correct when<!-- Page 8 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
he estimates the mortality occasioned by the use of tobacco in its various forms, at
five thousand annually. For ourself we are convinced that the suppression of intemperance
in spirituous liquors will never be effected while the agents and advocates
of our Temperance Societies, lecture with a pinch of snuff in their fingers and
a huge tobacco quid in their mouths. Tobacco slays its thousands, and doubtless
one tenth of the drunkards in our land have become so by first indulging in the
use of the dirty plant, and thus creating an unnatural thirst that called for liquid fire

<p>"A disquisition on the evils of using Tobacco. By Orin Fowler, A. M. Second
Edition. This pamphlet finds favor, * * * *. While we have the kindliest feelings
towards those who chew this disgusting substance, we hold its use, in every
form, in the most unqualified contempt. We care not to whom the remark may
apply, whether he be farmer, mechanic, lawyer, doctor, minister, judge or president;
but if in the light which Mr. Fowler has shed on the subject, any man
should continue to smoke or chew tobacco, or take snuff, public opinion ought to
frown him out of the pale of all civilized society. He that will contribute in any
way to a tax upon this nation of $25,000,000 a year for such stuff, may well be set
down as a bad citizen, unless he does it in ignorance."<!-- Page 9 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<h2>DISQUISITION.</h2>

<p>In this age of benevolent action, when much is being done to drive
away the darkness and delusions of many generations, and to diffuse
light and truth through the earth; it excites the liveliest joy in every
philanthropic bosom to witness the triumphant results already achieved.
Recent efforts to banish the use of intoxicating drinks, have
brought well nigh half the civilized world to a solemn pause: and the
work of reformation in this matter of spirit-drinking has gone so far,
and is yet making such sure progress, that many are rejoicing in the
lively hope that the day is nigh, even at the doors, when drunkenness,
with her burning legion of evils, will cease from the earth; and the
gospel of the grace of God will have free course and be glorified, and
the whole family of man become temperate, holy and happy. The
God of our salvation hasten that day apace; that our eyes may see it,
and rejoice and be glad in it, before we go to the grave.</p>

<p>But ere that day shall fully come, there is much land to be possessed.
Many a battle must yet be fought,&mdash;many a victory must
yet be won. Much light must yet be poured forth,&mdash;much darkness
must yet be driven away. The world is not yet half reformed. The
majority in the best portions of the earth&mdash;in this country even&mdash;are
on the side of free indulgence in every thing that pleases the appetite.</p>

<p>Intemperance in the use of intoxicating drinks,&mdash;and intemperance
in the use of <i>tobacco</i>, in the several forms of <i>smoking</i>, <i>snuffing</i> and
<i>chewing</i>; together with several other evils, which I need not here
specify, are even now predominant.</p>

<p>By intemperance in the use of tobacco, I mean all use of this drug
except that which is under the direction of enlightened, judicious
medical advice. With this exception, <i>entire abstinence</i> from this narcotic
substance constitutes the only safe and genuine temperance.&mdash;This
principle has been adopted extensively, in its application to intoxicating
drinks; but before it shall be universally adopted in that
application, it must be applied, and applied universally, to the <i>quid</i>,
and the <i>pipe</i>, and the <i>snuff-box</i>. Rum-drinking will not cease, till
tobacco-chewing, and tobacco-smoking, and snuff-taking, shall cease.
Though all who are attached to the quid, the pipe, or the snuff-box,
are not attached to the bottle; yet a vast multitude become attached
to the bottle, and this attachment is continued and increased, through
the poisonous, bewitching, and debasing influence of tobacco.</p>

<p>Moreover, the use of tobacco involves a train of evils, superadded
to its influence in perpetuating drunkenness, which cries aloud for
immediate and universal reformation. It is my present purpose to<!-- Page 10 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
consider these evils. And I wish to premise that, in this consideration,
I shall urge; that it is the duty of every friend of humanity&mdash;of
every lover of his country&mdash;of every Christian&mdash;and of every minister
of Christ, to <i>abstain</i>, himself, <i>immediately</i>, and <i>forever</i>, from <i>all</i>
use of tobacco, whether by <i>chewing</i>, <i>smoking</i>, or <i>snuffing</i>, except it be
<i>medicinally</i>; and to use the whole weight of his influence and example
to persuade others&mdash;and especially the young men and maidens
of this nation&mdash;to practice entire abstinence.</p>

<p>I am fully aware that the topic which I have selected, the position
which I lay down, and the purpose at which I aim, are not popular.
But what then? Did Clarkson and Wilberforce abandon the cause
of the enslaved African, when they found that abolition was unpopular
in the British Senate? Did Columbus abandon his purpose
of attempting to discover a new world, when he perceived that the
noble project of his noble soul was unpopular, with princes and people,
learned and ignorant? Did Jesus Christ abandon his purpose
to redeem a world lying in wickedness, when it became manifest that
his doctrines, and the pure benevolence of his holy soul, were unpopular.
And has it ever been <i>seemly</i> for one of his true and faithful
disciples to abandon the cause of human happiness, and the soul's
everlasting salvation, because the work of saving mercy is unpopular?</p>

<p>The theme of our present consideration, is doubtless unpopular.&mdash;But
we <i>should</i> not, we <i>will</i> not, therefore abandon the purpose of exposing
the evils of smoking, and chewing, and snuffing, that dirty
weed, which is so hostile to animal life, and so offensive to every creature
on earth, that no living being but man&mdash;and a loathsome worm,
called the tobacco-worm&mdash;will taste, or touch, or handle it.<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>


<p>Though it be unpopular to expose the evils of using tobacco; these
evils are so appalling, it will not do to slumber over them longer.&mdash;We
must look at them; we must lay them open&mdash;we must raise our
voice against them; (we would gladly raise it so high that it should
reach every family in the nation.) Yes, we must cry aloud and
spare not; or give up our claim to patriotism, and benevolence.</p>

<p>In approaching this subject, I am not unmindful of the pertinacity
with which men adhere to old habits. Dr. Rush speaks of a venerable
clergyman who closed a long sermon, in which he had controverted
what he supposed an heretical opinion, with these words: "I
tell you&mdash;I tell you, my brethren, I tell you again, that an <i>old error</i>
is better than a <i>new truth</i>." There are few who will assent to
this proposition in plain terms; but there are thousands upon thousands,
who act up to the very letter of it, constantly.&mdash;The history of
man is extensively a history of folly, delusion, and sin.</p>

<p>No error has been so absurd as not to find advocates&mdash;no habit has
been so foolish, or so deadly, as not to find martyrs. But of all the
delusions, which have prevailed among civilized men, there have been
few&mdash;perhaps none, but that of intoxication&mdash;so disgusting, so inex<!-- Page 11 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>cusable,
so destructive to health, and wealth, and life, as the habit
which we now ask you to consider.</p>

<p>It will be borne in mind that my position is this; it is the bounden
duty of every man and every woman to <i>abstain</i>, <i>immediately</i>, and
<i>forever</i>, from <i>all use</i> of tobacco, whether by <i>chewing</i>, <i>smoking</i>, or
<i>snuffing</i> except it be as a medicine. <span class="posit">This position I maintain,</span></p>

<p><span class="posit">I. From a consideration of the <i>history</i> of this loathsome weed.&mdash;</span>The
tobacco plant is a native of America. It was unknown in Europe
until some time after the discovery of America, by Columbus. It was
first carried to Europe by Sir Francis Drake, about the year 1560,
less than three hundred years ago. The natives of this continent
called it <i>petun</i>; the natives of the islands called it <i>yoli</i>. The
Spaniards gave it the name of <i>tobacco</i>, from <i>Tobaco</i>, a province of
Yucatan in Mexico, where they first found it, and first learned its
use. Its botanic name is <i>Nicotiana</i>, which it received from John
Nicot, then Ambassador from Francis II. to Portugal, who brought
it from Lisbon, and presented some of it to the Queen Catharine de
Medicis, and to the Grand Prior of the house of Lorraine; whence
it was sometimes called the Queen's herb, and the Grand Prior's herb.</p>

<p>The practice of smoking it in England, was introduced by Sir
Walter Raleigh, about the year 1584.</p>

<p>The cultivation of it is not uncommon in various parts of the globe;
but the seat of its most extensive culture is Virginia and Maryland,
in this country. In England its cultivation was forbidden&mdash;and we
believe is still forbidden&mdash;on penalty of forfeiting forty shillings for
every rod of ground planted with it.</p>

<p>James I. wrote a treatise against the use of it, which he called his
"Counterblast to Tobacco." Pope Urban VIII. issued a Bull, to excommunicate
all who used tobacco in the churches. The civil power
in Russia, Turkey, and Persia, was early arrayed against it. The
King of Denmark, who wrote a treatise against tobacco, observes
that "merchants often lay it in bog-houses, that, becoming impregnated
with the volatile salts of the excrements, it may be rendered
brisker, stronger, and more fœtid." It is said to be a fact, that in
manufacturing tobacco, it is frequently sprinkled with stale urine.</p>

<p>The use of tobacco never was general in Europe; and within the
last fifty or one hundred years, it has been banished from all the polite
circles of that part of the world. John Adams, the former President
of the United States, speaking of his own use of tobacco, and
referring to his residence in Europe, says: "Twice I gave up the
use of it; once when Minister at the Court of Hague; and afterwards
when Minister at the Court of London; for <i>no such offensive
practice is seen there</i>."</p>

<p>But although the cultivation of tobacco has been forbidden in many
countries of Europe; and though the manufacture of it is frequently
attended with circumstances so disgusting and offensive, that the
modesty of this paper will not permit me to detail them,&mdash;and though
the use of it is abandoned by all the respectable and polished circles
of Europe; yet in this nation, and among the lower orders abroad,<!-- Page 12 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
tobacco has triumphed: and the only hope of expelling it from our
land, lies in enlisting against it the power of enlightened public opinion&mdash;a
mightier power than any eastern despot wields.</p>

<p>Now from this brief sketch of the history of tobacco, it appears that
it was unknown to all the civilized world, till within three hundred
years; and that even now, all the polished and enlightened portion
of community abroad&mdash;and we add, a very respectable portion at
home&mdash;have no fellowship with the filthy weed. And can any man
justify himself in the daily use of a disgusting plant, against the
practice, opinion, and remonstrances of so large a portion of the civilized
world? Can he be discharging the obligations of his duty, and
enjoying the full amount of his privilege, while he suffers himself to
be a bond-slave to his quid, his pipe, or his snuff-box? Either an
important article of the vegetable kingdom, lay hid from the civilized
world nearly six thousand years; or since its discovery, the lovers of
tobacco have formed an entirely erroneous opinion of its properties.
In the sequel, I trust it will appear, that so far from possessing <i>valuable</i>
properties, it is one of the most <i>noxious</i> weeds that grows; that,
as an article of medicine, it possesses scarcely a redeeming quality;
and that, though it was not made in vain, if the world had remained
ignorant of it six thousand years longer, no cause of regret would
have been occasioned.</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain the position I have laid down,</p>

<p class="posit">II. From a consideration of the ruinous effects of tobacco upon
the <i>health</i> and <i>constitution</i> of men.</p>

<p>In considering this point, let us examine the <i>properties</i> of this weed,&mdash;the
prominent diseases which the use of it induces,&mdash;and the <i>experiences</i>
of unprejudiced observers. The properties of tobacco are decidedly
<i>poisonous</i>. In proof of this assertion, I appeal to ample and
unquestionable authority.</p>

<p>Professor Hitchcock says, "I group <i>alcohol</i>, <i>opium</i> and <i>tobacco</i> together,
as alike to be rejected; because they agree in being <i>poisonous</i>
in their natures." "In popular language," says he, "alcohol
is classed among the stimulants, and opium and tobacco among the
narcotics, whose ultimate effect upon the animal system is to produce
stupor and insensibility." He says, "Most of the powerful vegetable
poisons, such as hen-bane, hemlock, thorn-apple, prussic acid, deadly
night-shade, fox-glove and poison sumach, have an effect on the
animal system scarcely to be distinguished from that of opium and
<i>tobacco</i>. They impair the organs of digestion, and may bring on fatuity,
palsy, delirium, or apoplexy," He says, "In those not accustomed
to it, <i>tobacco</i> excites nausea, vomiting, dizziness, indigestion,
mental dejection, and in short, the whole train of <i>nervous</i> complaints."</p>

<p>Dr. Rees, in his Cyclopedia, says; "A drop or two of the chemical
oil of tobacco, being put upon the tongue of a cat, produces violent
convulsions, and death itself in the space of a minute."</p>

<p>Dr. Hossack classes <i>tobacco</i> with opium, ether, mercury, and other
articles of the materia medica. He calls tobacco a "<i>fashionable
poison</i>," in the various forms in which that narcotic is employed.<!-- Page 13 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>&mdash;
He says, "The great increase of dyspepsia; the late alarming frequency
of apoplexy, palsy, epilepsy, and other diseases of the nervous
system; is attributable, in part, to the use of tobacco."</p>

<p>Dr. Waterhouse says that Linn&aelig;us, in his natural arrangement, has
placed tobacco in the class <i>Lurid&aelig;</i>&mdash;which signifies, pale, ghastly,
livid, dismal and fatal. "To the same ominous class," he adds,
"belong fox-glove, hen-bane, deadly night-shade, lobelia, and another
poisonous plant, bearing the tremendous name Atropa, one of the
furies." He says, "When tobacco is taken into the stomach for
the first time, it creates nausea and extreme disgust. If swallowed,
it excites violent convulsions of the stomach and of the bowels to eject
the poison either upward or downward. If it be not very speedily
and entirety ejected, it produces great anxiety, vertigo, faintness, and
prostration of all the senses; and, in some instances, death has followed."
The oil of this plant, he adds, is one of the strongest vegetable
poisons, insomuch that we know of no animal that can resist its
mortal effects. Moreover, says Dr. Waterhouse, after a long and
honorable course of practice, "I never observed so many pallid faces,
and so many marks of declining health; nor ever knew so many
hectical habits, and consumptive affections, as of late years; and I
trace this alarming inroad on young constitutions, <i>principally</i> to the
pernicious custom of smoking cigars."</p>

<p>Professor Graham says "Tobacco is one of the most <i>powerful</i> and
<i>deadly poisons</i> in the vegetable kingdom." "Its effects on the living
tissues of the animal system," he adds, "are always to destroy life;
as the experiments made on pigeons, cats, and other animals abundantly
prove."</p>

<p>The Editors of the Journal of Health say, "Tobacco is in fact an
absolute poison. A very moderate quantity introduced into the system,
even applying the moistened leaves to the stomach, has been
known very suddenly to extinguish life. In whatever form it may be
employed, a portion of the active principles of tobacco, mixed with
the saliva, invariably finds its way to the stomach, and disturbs or
impairs the functions of that organ. Hence most, if not all, who
are accustomed to the use of tobacco, labor under dyspeptic symptoms.
Our advice is to desist immediately and entirely from the use
of tobacco in every form, and in any quantity, however small. A
reform, to be efficacious, must be entire and complete."</p>

<p>Dr. Warren says, "The common belief that tobacco is beneficial
to the teeth, is entirely erroneous; on the contrary, by its poisonous
and relaxing qualities, it is positively injurious." Says another
physician, "Though snuff has been prescribed for the head-ache,
catarrh, and some species of opthalmia, and sometimes with good
effect; yet in all cases where its use is <i>continued</i>, it not only fails of
its medical effect, but commits great ravages on the whole nervous
system, superinducing hypochondria, tremors, a thickening of the
voice, and premature decay of all the intellectual powers."</p>

<p>As a diuretic, Dr. Fowler, and others, have found it in some
cases to be valuable. Its narcotic properties have sometimes as<!-- Page 14 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>suaged
the tooth-ache; but it always hastens the destruction of the
teeth. But of all substances in pharmacy, there seems to be a general
agreement among medical writers, that tobacco, though occasionally
beneficial, is the most unmanageable, and used with the least
confidence.</p>

<p>A multitude of cases, confirming these views, have actually occurred;
two or three of which I will cite. A clergyman, who commenced
the use of tobacco in youth, says, "that no very injurious
consequences were experienced till he entered the ministry, when
his system began to feel its dreadful effects. His voice, his appetite,
and his strength failed; and he was sorely afflicted with sickness
at the stomach, indigestion, emaciation, melancholy, and a prostration
of the whole nervous system. All this," says he, "I attribute
to the pernicious habit of smoking and chewing tobacco." At
length he abandoned the quid and the pipe. His voice, appetite,
and strength were soon restored; all aches subsided, and in a little
time general health was enjoyed.</p>

<p>Another clergyman writes, "I thank God, and I thank you, for
your advice to abandon smoking; my strength has doubled since I
relinquished this abominable practice."</p>

<p>A respectable gentleman in middle life, who commenced chewing
tobacco at the age of eighteen, was long afflicted with depression
of spirits, great emaciation, and the usual dyspeptic symptoms.&mdash;All
attempts to relieve him were fruitless, till he was persuaded to
dispense with his quid. Immediately his spirits revived, and he soon
regained his health.<a name="FNanchor_B_2" id="FNanchor_B_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_B_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>Cases of reform and cure are occurring by thousands, every year,
all over the land. Let every lover of tobacco, who is afflicted with
<i>dyspepsia</i>, and nervous maladies, <i>reform</i>, immediately and entirely;
and let him adopt a simple and rational system of diet, regimen,
and employment; and in nine cases out of ten, he may hope to enjoy
good health, and live long to bless the world.</p>

<p>The conclusion from all this evidence is established, that tobacco
<i>is</i> an <i>active poison</i>; that its constant use induces the most distressing
and fatal diseases; and that, as a medicine, it is rarely needful,
and never used, even <i>medicinally</i>, with entire confidence. This
loathsome weed, then, should not be used, even <i>medicinally</i>, except in
extreme cases, and then in the hands of a skillful physician. For every
man&mdash;and especially for every boy, who has hardly entered
his teens&mdash;to take this poison into his own hands, and determine
for himself how much he will use, is as preposterous, as if he were
to take upon himself to deal out arsenic, corrosive sublimate, or calomel.</p>

<p>No man can devote himself to the pipe, the quid, or the snuff-box,
without certain injury to his health and constitution. He may not<!-- Page 15 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
perceive the injury at once, on account of immediate exhilaration;
but complicated chronic complaints will creep upon him apace, making
life a burden, and issuing in premature dissolution. And just so
certain as it is our duty to do no murder,&mdash;to use all lawful means
to preserve our lives, and the lives of others; as certain is it our duty
and our privilege to practice <i>entire abstinence</i> from the use of tobacco.</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain the position I have laid down,</p>

<p class="posit">III. From the consideration of the ruinous effects of tobacco upon
the <i>intellect</i>.</p>

<p>Here, again, let Professor Hitchcock speak. Says he, "Intoxicating
drinks, opium and tobacco, exert a pernicious influence upon
the intellect. They tend directly to debilitate the organs; and we
cannot take a more effectual course to cloud the understanding,
weaken the memory, unfix the attention, and confuse all the mental
operations, than by thus entailing upon ourselves the whole hateful
train of nervous maladies. These can bow down to the earth an intellect
of giant strength, and make it grind in bondage, like Sampson
shorn of his locks and deprived of his vision. The use of tobacco
may seem to soothe the feelings, and quicken the operations of the
mind; but to what purpose is it that the machine is furiously running
and buzzing after the balance wheel is taken off?"</p>

<p>The late Gov. Sullivan, speaking of the use of tobacco, says, "It
has never failed to render me dull and heavy, to interrupt my usual
alertness of thought, and to weaken the powers of my mind in analyzing
subjects and defining ideas."</p>

<p>The actual loss of <i>intellectual</i> power, which tobacco has hitherto
occasioned, and is still causing, in this Christian nation, is immense.
How immense, it is impossible accurately to calculate. Many a man
who might have been a giant, has not risen above mediocrity; and
many a man who might have been respectable and useful, has sunk
into obscurity, and buried his talents in the earth. This is a consideration
of deepest interest to every philanthropist, patriot, and
Christian in the land, and especially to all our youth. We live at
a time, and under circumstances, which call for the exertion of all
our intellectual strength, cultivated, improved and sanctified, to the
highest measure of possibility. Error, ignorance, and sin, must be
met and vanquished; they must be met and vanquished by light and
love. The eye of angels is upon us,&mdash;the eye of God is upon us,&mdash;and
shall we fetter, and palsy, and ruin our intellectual capabilities,
for the paltry pleasure of using one of the most poisonous, loathsome,
and destructive weeds found in the whole vegetable kingdom? Let
us rather shake off this abominable practice, and rise, as individuals
and as a nation, in all our intellectual potency,&mdash;and let us go forth
from day to day, to the noble purposes of our destiny, untrammelled
by the quid, or the pipe, or the snuff-box; and before another generation
shall lie down in the grave, our efforts and our example may
cause the light of human science, and the light of civil and religious
liberty, and the light of Bible truth, to blaze through all our valleys,<!-- Page 16 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
and over all our hills, from Greenland to Cape Horn,&mdash;and with a
lustre that shall illumine the world.</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain my position,</p>

<p class="posit">IV. From a consideration of the ruinous effects of tobacco upon
public and private <i>morals</i>.</p>

<p>The ruinous effects of tobacco upon public and private morals, are
seen in the idle, sauntering habits, which the use of it engenders,&mdash;in
the benumbing, grovelling, stupid sensations which it induces,&mdash;but
especially in perpetuating and extending the practice of using intoxicating
drinks.</p>

<p>Governor Sullivan has truly said, "that the tobacco pipe excites a
demand for an extraordinary quantity of some beverage to supply the
waste of glandular secretion, in proportion to the expense of saliva;
and ardent spirits are the common substitutes; and the smoker is often
reduced to a state of dram drinking, and finishes his life as a sot."</p>

<p>Dr. Agnew has truly said, that "the use of the pipe leads to the
immoderate use of ardent spirits."</p>

<p>Dr. Rush has truly said, "that smoking and chewing tobacco, by
rendering water and other simple liquors insipid to the taste, dispose
very much to the stronger stimulus of ardent spirits; hence [says he]
the practice of smoking cigars, has been followed by the use of brandy
and water as common drink."</p>

<p>A writer in the Genius of Temperance, says that his practice of
smoking and chewing the filthy weed, "produced a continual thirst
for stimulating drinks; and this tormenting thirst [says he] led me
into the habit of drinking ale, porter, brandy, and other kinds of spirit,
even to the extent, at times, of partial intoxication." He adds,
"I reformed; and after I had subdued this appetite for tobacco, I
lost all desire for stimulating drinks."</p>

<p>Now the fact that some chew, and smoke, and snuff without becoming
sots, proves nothing against the general principle, that it is
the natural tendency of using tobacco to promote intoxication. Probably
<i>one tenth</i>, at least, of all the drunkards annually made in the nation,
and throughout the world, are made drunkards through the use
of tobacco. If thirty thousand drunkards are made annually in the
United States, three thousand must be charged to the use of tobacco.
If thirty thousand drunkards die annually, in the United States, three
thousand of these deaths must be charged to the use of tobacco. If
twenty thousand criminals are sentenced to our penitentiaries in
twenty years, through the influence of strong drink, two thousand
must be charged to the use of tobacco. If fifty-six millions of gallons
of ardent spirits have been annually consumed in this country,
five and a half millions must be charged to the use of tobacco. And
of all the Sabbath-breaking, profanity, quarrelling, and crime of every
description, caused by the use of intoxicating drink; a tithe must
be charged to the use of tobacco. And what friend of good morals,&mdash;what
friend of man,&mdash;what friend of his country,&mdash;what friend of
Christ and true religion,&mdash;and especially, what friend of the temperance
cause,&mdash;can look at these results with the eye of candor and<!-- Page 17 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
compassion for his fellow-men, and then not deliberately resolve that
he will never chew another quid, nor smoke another whiff, nor snuff
another pinch of the dirty weed?</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain my position,</p>

<p><span class="posit">V. From a consideration of the amazing <i>waste of property</i>, which
the use of tobacco involves.</span> On this point I have been unable to obtain
the means for making out a perfectly accurate statistical result.
I can only approximate a definite calculation. This approximation,
however, will serve all the purposes of this argument.</p>

<p>We will examine <i>three items</i>: the <i>cost</i> of the article,&mdash;the <i>time</i> wasted
by the use of it,&mdash;and the <i>pauperism</i> it occasions. From a statement
lately furnished me from the Treasury department of our National
Government, exhibiting the quantity and value of cigars and
snuff, exported from and imported into the United States, annually,
from 1st October, 1820 to 30th September, 1832, it appears that the
value of cigars imported into the United States in 1821, was $113,601.
In 1827 it was $174,931. In 1832 it was $473,134; while
from the same document it appears that the value of cigars exported,
in each of those years, was about one quarter the value of imports.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that, in 1832, about half a million of dollars were
paid for imported cigars; while in 1821, only $113,601 were paid;
being more than a four-fold increase in eleven years. Whether
there has been a corresponding increase in the value of domestic cigars
consumed, I have no means of determining. From the fact of
so prodigious an increase of imported cigars, I am led to fear that
the evil of cigar smoking has increased in this country within ten
years, far more rapidly than the increase of population. From this
treasury document, it appears also, that in 1824, the value of unmanufactured
tobacco exported from the United States, was</p>

<p>Whether the quantity consumed in this country equals the quantity
exported, or exceeds that quantity, I have no data enabling me to
give a definite answer. But from the fact that large quantities of tobacco
are raised in various other parts of the world, for foreign consumption;
and from the fact that the people of this country are,
above all other people under the sun, a chewing, smoking, snuffing
people; I have very little doubt that the amount used in this country<!-- Page 18 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
is double that exported. If so, the sum total paid annually, for this
vile weed, in this christian country, is $19,503,222. But as I wish in
this examination, to put the estimate <i>below</i> rather than <i>above</i> the truth,
I will set down the value of tobacco, cigars, and snuff, consumed annually
in this nation, as equal to the amount exported; that is, in
round numbers, $10,000,000.</p>

<p>That this is a very <i>low</i> estimate, will appear by another conclusive
calculation.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1830, the population of the U. States,
over twenty years of age, is about six millions. Suppose one in four
of our adult population, use tobacco in some form; (and this is a
very moderate supposition,) it gives one million, five hundred thousand:
and suppose one in twelve of those who have not reached the
age of twenty, use it; it gives five hundred thousand more: making
a total of two millions&mdash;or one sixth of our population&mdash;who use tobacco
in some form.</p>

<p>Now suppose the expense to the consumers of this noxious drug,
varies according to the quantity, and mode of using it. The expense
to some is two dollars a year, to some it is five, and to others
ten, twenty, and even fifty dollars a year. A laboring man, of my
acquaintance, who did not use tobacco extravagantly, and only by
chewing, told me that it cost him five dollars a year. A young lady
of my acquaintance, says her snuff costs eight dollars a year. If
a man pay three cents a day for cigars, it amounts to ten dollars,
ninety-five cents a year. If he pay six cents, it amounts to twenty-one
dollars, ninety cents a year. If he pay twelve and a half cents,
it amounts to forty-four dollars, sixty-two cents a year.</p>

<p>It is the opinion of good judges, that very many, who smoke freely
and use Spanish cigars, pay more than fifty dollars a year for
this foolish gratification.</p>

<p>King James, in his "Counterblast," says, "Some of the gentry
of this land, bestow three, some four hundred pounds a year, upon
this precious stink."</p>

<p>It will certainly be a moderate calculation to put down one quarter
of the consumers at two dollars a year,&mdash;one quarter at five,&mdash;one
quarter at eight,&mdash;and one quarter at ten dollars a year. Then
the several items will stand thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Again: the amount of tobacco annually consumed in France, as
appears from authentic documents, is about seven millions of pounds;
which is about one pound to every four persons. The amount annually
consumed in England, as appears from authentic documents,
is about seventeen millions; which is about one pound to every man,<!-- Page 19 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
woman and child, in that nation.<a name="FNanchor_C_3" id="FNanchor_C_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_C_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> In the United States, probably
there are eight times as much used as in France, and three times as
much as in England, in proportion to our population. If so, the
quantity used in this country cannot fall short of thirty-five millions
of pounds;<a name="FNanchor_D_4" id="FNanchor_D_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_D_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a> which, at thirty cents a pound, amounts to ten and a
half millions of dollars; not including cigars and snuff, which cost
half as much more; making the total sum fifteen and three fourths
millions of dollars. And this enormous sum is doubtless <i>below</i> what
the article actually cost the consumers.</p>

<p>From these <i>three</i> results, we believe there cannot be a doubt that
the actual expense of tobacco, in its various forms, to the consumers
in this country, may safely be set down at <i>ten millions of dollars a
year</i>.</p>

<p>The amount of <i>time</i> lost by the consumers of tobacco, is another
item of no inconsiderable moment. Some spend two, three, and four
hours a day in this vile indulgence. To all who use the article, in
any way, it occasions the loss of more or less time. If we put down
the average amount at half an hour a day; and reckon the time thus
lost at four cents an hour, it will amount&mdash;not reckoning Sabbaths&mdash;to
six dollars, twenty-six cents a year, for each individual; which,
for the whole company of consumers, is an amount of $12,520,000.</p>

<p>The <i>pauperism</i> which tobacco occasions, is another fearful item.
Multitudes who are scarcely able to procure the necessaries of life,
will shift, by sacrificing health and comfort, to procure the daily
<i>quantum sufficit</i> of tobacco. Many very poor families use tobacco,
in all ways. Now suppose a poor family use twenty-five cents'
worth of tobacco a week; it will amount to twelve dollars fifty cents
a year,&mdash;and in fifty years, reckoning principal and interest, it will
amount to three thousand five hundred and fifty-two dollars.</p>

<p>Just look at this tax for snuff and tobacco, in a single aspect more.
Many think it will make <i>no</i> man the poorer, to pay six cents a day
for this indulgence. It will make <i>every</i> man the poorer. Let any
young mechanic, or farmer, or merchant, consume six and a quarter
cents' worth of this drug a day&mdash;beginning at twenty years of
age, and continuing until he is sixty years old&mdash;and the sum total,
reckoning principal and interest, will amount, in these forty years,
to three thousand five hundred and twenty-nine dollars, thirty-six
cents.</p>

<p>If the <i>cost</i> of tobacco,&mdash;the <i>neglect of business</i> which it occasions,&mdash;the
expense of the <i>pipes</i> and the <i>boxes</i>, and the various <i>apparatus</i>
which the use of it involves,&mdash;and the <i>intoxication</i> to which it leads,&mdash;all
be reckoned up, the amount of <i>pauperism</i> which this weed
brings upon the nation, cannot be less than one quarter of the sum
total of all our pauperism. And the sum total of the pauperism in<!-- Page 20 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
this nation, has been shown, again and again, to be not less than
twelve millions of dollars, annually. Hence the pauper tax, occasioned
by the use of tobacco, may be set down at three millions of
dollars, annually.</p>

<p>To this sum should be added one-tenth of the waste of property,
which strong drink occasions; inasmuch as one-tenth of the rum-drinking
must be charged to tobacco. Now, it has been estimated
that the whole cost of strong drink used annually, in this country,
amounts to one hundred and twenty-five millions of dollars; a tenth
of which is twelve and a half millions of dollars. If this tithe be added
to the above estimate, it will make the sum total thirty-eight and
a half millions. But as I intend my estimates shall be <i>moderate</i>, I
will say nothing of the waste of property which tobacco occasions in
connection with strong drink. I will put down the sum total as
above twenty-five millions of dollars.</p>

<p>Twenty-five millions of dollars, consumed by the use of tobacco,
in this Christian nation, annually; and not a little of it by professors
of religion, and ministers of the gospel, who are required by
their Lord and Master to deny themselves,&mdash;to take up their cross,&mdash;to
let their light shine before men, that they may see their good
works, and glorify our Father in heaven. Nearly the whole of this
twenty-five millions of dollars is a <i>dead loss</i> to the nation; yes, it is
infinitely <i>worse</i> than a dead loss; it not only does no good, but it
actually goes to make fools and beggars, idlers and sots,&mdash;to purchase
dyspepsia, early graves and everlasting shame. And what would
this vast amount of property accomplish, if saved and devoted to useful
purposes.</p>

<p>Twenty-five millions of dollars annually, if applied to the improvement
of agriculture, manufactures, and commerce, and to the advancement
of the arts, sciences, and true religion, would accomplish
everything for this nation, that the enlightened patriot and true
Christian can ask for.</p>

<p>Twenty-five millions of dollars, annually, would soon furnish canals,
and rail-roads, and all other desirable facilities for intercommunication
throughout the nation. Twenty-five millions of dollars, annually,
would sustain all our colleges, academies and other schools,
and all the religious and benevolent institutions of this whole country.
It would rear seminaries of learning in every State where they are
needed; and it would plant a Sabbath school, with a sufficient library
in every school district.</p>

<p>Twenty-five millions of dollars, annually, if applied in all feasible
and suitable ways, would give freedom, with all the blessings of
Christianity to the colored race in our own country, and throughout<!-- Page 21 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
the continent of Africa in a very few years: and would terminate
slavery and the slave-trade in every part of the world.</p>

<p>Twenty-five millions of dollars annually, would send forth to the
nations now perishing in heathen darkness, ten thousand missionaries,
and five millions of tracts, every year, provided the men could
be found.</p>

<p>Twenty-five millions of dollars, annually, would, in five years, furnish
all the money necessary to carry into complete execution, that
noble purpose of the American Bible Society, of giving a copy of the
Bible, within a specified time, to every accessible family on the
earth. And what friend of man is there among us,&mdash;what patriot
is there,&mdash;what Christian is there,&mdash;who can look at these truths,
and not make up his mind to abandon all use of tobacco, <i>forever</i>;
and to exert the whole weight of his influence and example to persuade
others to do the same?</p>

<p>I am aware, indeed, that it may be said, if the whole company of
tobacco-chewers, smokers, and snuffers, should at once abandon all
use of this weed, and thus withdraw their whole patronage, this
twenty-five millions of dollars, which now gives wealth to many a
man engaged in growing, manufacturing, and vending the poison,
would be so much capital unemployed; and the means of living
would be cut off from many a family,&mdash;and bankruptcy, and wretchedness
would be the consequent portion of many an individual. This
may be true. And it may be true, too, that the like consequences
would follow the universal abandonment of intoxicating liquors. But
what then? Shall one sixth part of the nation continue to use this
poison, because, forsooth, the <i>producers</i> and <i>venders</i> of it will lose
their profits if it be abandoned? Shall the <i>intellect</i>, and <i>health</i>, and
<i>comfort</i>, and <i>wealth</i>, and <i>lives</i> of hundreds and thousands of our fellow
citizens, be sacrificed yearly; and widows and orphans be multiplied
by scores and fifties, in every section of this wide-spreading
country; and one of the prominent auxiliaries of <i>intemperance</i>,&mdash;and
consequently of <i>crime</i>, and <i>insanity</i>, and <i>eternal woe</i>&mdash;be cherished;
and twenty-five millions of dollars be <i>wasted</i>, and worse than wasted;
and all this, that the <i>producers</i> and <i>venders</i> may feed and fatten on
the gains? This objection lies equally against the temperance reform
and every other reform, where cupidity and avarice are involved.</p>

<p>As to the producers, it is affirmed on good authority, that hemp
and corn, and other useful articles may be substituted without loss,
and even with advantage. As to the venders, their capital may all
be profitably employed upon valuable merchandise, without damage.
But if it were not so; where <i>health</i>, <i>life</i>, and <i>happiness</i> are involved,
no good man can hesitate. The path of duty is plain. We are bound
to walk in it, even though it run counter to the gains of those engaged
in unlawful commerce.</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain my position,</p>

<p class="posit">VI. From a consideration of the <i>mortality</i> which tobacco occasions.</p>

<p>Some of my readers may be startled at this consideration. They<!-- Page 22 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
may not have dreamed, even, that tobacco <i>kills</i> any body. So insidious
are the effects of this poison, and so insensible have the community
been to its abominations, that very few have regarded the use of
tobacco as the cause of swelling our bills of mortality. But though
appalling, it is nevertheless true, that tobacco carries vast multitudes
to the grave, all over our country, every year. Says Dr. Salmon,
"I am confident more people have died of apoplexies, since the use
of snuff in one year, than have died of that disease in an hundred
years before; and most, if not all, whom I have observed to die, of
late of that disease, were extreme and constant snuff-takers." The
late Rev. Dr. Samuel Cooper, of Boston, by constant use of snuff,
brought on a disorder of the head, which was thought to have ended
his days. A very large quantity of hardened Scotch snuff was found,
by a <i>post mortem</i> examination, between the external nose and the
brain. The late Gov. Sullivan, speaking of Gov. Hancock, the early
President of Congress, says, "Gov. Hancock was an immoderate
chewer of tobacco; but being a well-bred man, and a perfect gentleman,
he, from a sense of decorum, refrained from spitting in company,
or in well-dressed rooms. This produced the habit of swallowing
the juice of the tobacco, the consequence of which was, his stomach
became inactive, and a natural appetite seldom returned; the
agreeable sensations of hunger could not be experienced but by the
use of stimulants, to satisfy which he swallowed more food than his
digestive powers could dispose of. This derangement in chylification
increased his gout, his stomach became paralytic, and he died at the
age of fifty-eight."</p>

<p>Again, says Governor Sullivan, "My own brother, the active
General Sullivan, began early in life to take snuff. It injured essentially
a fine voice which he possessed as a public speaker. When
he was an officer in the American army, he carried his snuff loose
in his pocket. He said he did this because the opening of a snuff-box
in the field of review, or on the field of battle, was inconvenient.
At times he had violent pains in the head; the intervals grew shorter
and shorter, and the returns more violent, when his sufferings
ended in a stroke of palsy, which rendered him insensible to pain,
made him helpless and miserable, and lodged him in the grave before
he was fifty years of age; and I have no doubt [says the Governor,]
but all this sprung from the use of snuff." He adds, "I have known
some persons live to old age, in the extravagant use of tobacco; but
they bear a small proportion to those who, by the habit of using tobacco,
have been swept into the grave in <i>early</i> or <i>middle</i> life."</p>

<p>Professor Silliman mentions two affecting cases of young men,
in the Institution with which he is connected, who were carried to
an early grave by tobacco. One of them, he says, entered college
with an athletic frame; but he acquired the habit of using tobacco,
and would sit and smoke by the hour together. His friends tried to
persuade him to quit the practice; but he loved his lust, and would
have it, live or die: the consequence was, he went down to the
grave, a suicide.<!-- Page 23 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>One of the German periodicals says, the chief German physiologists
compute, that of twenty deaths of men between eighteen and
twenty-five, ten, that is, one half, originate in the waste of the constitution
by smoking. They declare, also, with much truth, that tobacco
burns out the <i>blood</i>, the <i>teeth</i>, the <i>eyes</i>, and the <i>brain</i>.</p>

<p>To this unequivocal testimony, which is confirmed by the observation
of every intelligent person who has turned his attention to this
matter, much more might be added; but it is unnecessary. How
large a proportion of the twenty thousand deaths&mdash;reckoning one
death to a hundred souls&mdash;which occur annually, among the two
millions of tobacco consumers in this country, are to be charged to
the use of this deadly narcotic, I am unable definitely to determine.
If we suppose one quarter of these deaths to be caused by tobacco,
it will give us the number of five thousand. Five thousand deaths
in these United States, every year from the use of tobacco! and
this is doubtless far below the actual number. Five thousand valuable
lives sacrificed in this enlightened land, annually, in the use of
a dirty plant, that no living creature, except man and the tobacco
worm, will touch, or taste, or handle. Five thousand men and women
carried to the grave, yearly, by a poisonous weed, which does
<i>no good</i>, and which, for filthiness and disgust, scarcely has its parallel
in the whole vegetable kingdom. Is there a <i>Christian</i>,&mdash;is there
a <i>patriot</i>,&mdash;is there a <i>friend</i> of humanity,&mdash;is there an <i>individual</i>, that
values his own probationary existence,&mdash;who can look at the sweeping
mortality which tobacco brings upon the nation, and longer indulge
his attachment to his quid, his pipe or his snuff-box? Is there
one who will pause and look at this matter, and not resolve that he
will, <i>forthwith</i>, <i>entirely</i>, and <i>forever</i>, abandon a practice which does
so much to people the grave?</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain my position,</p>

<p class="posit">VII.&mdash;From a consideration of the <i>apologies</i> of the lovers of tobacco.</p>

<p>I call them <i>apologies</i>. They cannot be considered <i>reasons</i>. Almost
every lover of the dirty weed, feels that he needs an apology. One
will tell us he has a cold, watery stomach, and he thinks that tobacco,
by promoting expectoration, relieves the difficulty. Another
will tell us he is very much troubled with indigestion, and he thinks
tobacco relieves the difficulty; though, in truth, tobacco is the very
worst drug he could use to relieve that disease, and is among the
primordial causes of inducing it. Another will tell us that he is afflicted
with the rising of his food after eating, and he thinks tobacco
gives immediate relief; not suspecting, perhaps, that this rising of
the food is occasioned by over eating. Another will tell us he has
a distressing difficulty in the head, and brain, and he thinks a little
good Scotch snuff affords relief; as though the filling the pores,
and cavities of the head, and clogging up the brain, with this dirty
stuff, would remove a disease which in most cases it originates.</p>

<p>Others use tobacco to preserve the teeth; and this, though it is a
solemn truth, that many a one loses his teeth by smoking and chew<!-- Page 24 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>ing
the poisonous plant. Others, again, use tobacco to excite the
mind to more vigorous intellectual effort. But when and where do
we find great lovers of tobacco great students, and intellectual giants?
Dr. Rush says, "I suspect tobacco is oftener used for the
<i>want</i> of ideas, than to excite them." There are some whose apology
for using tobacco is, that it guards them against the power of
contagious diseases. But Dr. Rees affirms that tobacco does not
contain an antidote against contagion, and that, in general, it has no
antiseptic power; and is therefore of no special use. There is
another class still, who use tobacco because it soothes the irksomeness
of life. They fear solitude; and to prevent self-examination,
and to while away their probation time, they fly to the <i>pipe</i>, <i>quid</i>, and
<i>snuff-box</i>; and soon, by an easy transition, to the wine-glass and
brandy-bottle.</p>

<p>These are the <i>usual apologies</i> of the devotees to tobacco. And
what do they amount to? In truth, the common opinion that tobacco
is good for the head-ache,&mdash;weak eyes,&mdash;cold and watery stomachs,&mdash;the
preservation of the teeth,&mdash;and the like, is sheer delusion.
Let every man and woman, who would live long, and usefully, and
happily, awake from this delusion; and let no one, as he values
health, life, and salvation, <i>taste</i>, <i>touch</i>, or <i>handle</i>, the filthy poison.</p>

<p class="posit">I maintain my position,</p>

<p><span class="posit">VIII, <span class="smcap">and lastly</span>.&mdash;From a consideration of the <i>eternal ruin</i>
which tobacco occasions.</span> On this point, a word or two only, will
suffice. That tobacco carries many a soul down to the pit of eternal
woe, is manifest from its connection with drunkenness, and from
its inducing disease and death. Every man who dies a drunkard,
and every man who, knowingly and recklessly, brings upon
himself disease and death through the influence of tobacco, is a
<i>suicide</i>. And drunkards and suicides cannot inherit the kingdom of
God. How many will at last, ascribe their eternal ruin to alcohol
and tobacco, cannot now be told.</p>

<p>That it will be a great multitude, (perhaps a great multitude which
no man can number,) we have no reason to doubt.</p>

<p>What then, I ask, <i>ought</i> to be <i>done</i>? What <i>can</i> be done? What
<i>must</i> be done? If this poisonous narcotic be of <i>recent</i> origin; if it
be ruinous to the <i>health</i> and <i>constitution</i>, and <i>intellect</i>, and <i>public</i>
and <i>private morals</i>; if it occasions an amazing <i>waste of property</i>,&mdash;and
a multitude of <i>deaths</i>,&mdash;and <i>eternal ruin</i> to many precious souls;
and if it do no good,&mdash;and there be no <i>apology</i> for using it, which
will bear examination; then <i>something ought to be done</i>, and it ought
to be done <i>immediately</i>. And, <i>only one</i> thing need be done. And
that <i>can</i> be done, and it ought to be done. It is this:&mdash;<i>tobacco can
be abandoned</i>. And if moral influence enough can be enlisted, it <i>will</i>
be abandoned.</p>

<p>TOTAL ABSTINENCE is the only sure remedy. TOTAL
ABSTINENCE will deliver us from all the evils which this weed
has brought down upon individuals and families, and the nation.&mdash;Nothing
else will do it. And total abstinence can be adopted and<!-- Page 25 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
practiced. True; in some cases, it may cost an <i>effort</i>; but, in every
instance, three weeks' perseverance will overcome the habit.
Three weeks' <i>total abstinence</i>, will disenthrall every victim, and give
him the prospect of <i>freedom</i>, <i>plenty</i>, <i>health</i>, and <i>happiness</i>. And
shall this effort be made? A <i>mighty</i> effort it must be, to liberate and
save this whole nation&mdash;and especially our young men and maidens&mdash;from
the curses of the <i>quid</i>, the <i>pipe</i>, and the <i>snuff-box</i>.</p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to my fellow citizens. I appeal to the <i>nation</i>, and the
<i>whole nation</i>.</span> <i>Shall</i> the effort be made?</p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to <i>patriots</i>.</span> Patriotism forbids the man who loves his
country, to shrink from any personal sacrifice, if he can thereby arrest
some great national evil. That the use of tobacco is a great national
evil, appears from the considerations which have been laid before
you. It has been shown that tobacco is weakening the physical
and mental energies of this nation,&mdash;that it is depraving our morals,
and destroying the public conscience,&mdash;and that it is causing an amazing
waste of property, and health and life. I ask every patriot to
look at this portentous evil. Every true patriot, who will examine
the length, breadth, and depth of this evil, cannot but feel that it
claims his attention. And he will enquire what efforts, what sacrifices,
can deliver us from the curses of this narcotic? The answer
to this inquiry is an <i>easy</i> answer,&mdash;the effort is an <i>easy</i> effort,&mdash;the
sacrifice is an <i>easy</i> sacrifice. Let every true patriot in our country
abstain from the poison, <i>immediately</i>, <i>entirely</i>, and <i>forever</i>; and let
him use the whole weight of his influence and example to persuade
others&mdash;and especially the young men and maidens of this republic&mdash;to
practice entire abstinence; and the work will soon be done.
We put the question to every true patriot: <span class="appeal"><i>will you do it</i>?</span></p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to <i>Christians</i>.</span> Your religion requires you to abstain
from the very appearance of evil. It requires you to deny yourselves,
to take up your cross, and to follow Christ through evil, as well
as through good report. Is there no appearance of evil, in the use
of tobacco? Can the Christian deny himself and follow Christ, with
the quid, or pipe in his mouth, or the contents of the snuff-box in
his nose? If Christ himself, were here on earth, in this age of action,
when six hundred millions of men, for whom he died, are perishing
for lack of vision&mdash;think you he would waste a single cent of
<i>property</i>, or a single moment of <i>time</i>, or a single ounce of health
and mental energy, in the habitual use of this narcotic? Would he
<i>handle</i>, <i>touch</i>, or <i>taste</i>, the poison? And will <i>you</i>, whose names are
written in his book,&mdash;<i>you</i>, who have been bought with his blood,
and sanctified through his grace, and made heirs of all the riches of
his kingdom,&mdash;<i>you</i>, whom he requires to be <i>examples</i> in all things,&mdash;will
you <i>handle</i>, or <i>touch</i> or <i>taste</i> it? Let every Christian in our
country, abstain from this poison, <i>immediately</i>, <i>entirely</i>, and <i>forever</i>;
and let him use the whole weight of his influence and example, to
persuade others to practice <i>entire abstinence</i>; and this work of reform
will soon be done. We put the question to every true Christian:<span class="appeal">
<i>will you do it</i>?</span><!-- Page 26 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to the <i>youth</i> of both sexes.</span> You are the flower and the
hope not only of this nation, but of all nations struggling for freedom.
The destinies of this republic are about being placed, under
God, in your hands; and inasmuch as all the friends of freedom,
everywhere, are looking up to our institutions for light and aid, the
destinies of the world will rest with a mightier weight of responsibility
upon your shoulders, than upon any other generation that has
come forth upon the stage of action, for twenty centuries. The importance
of sound and enlightened principles&mdash;of pure and elevated
examples, and independent and decided action in <i>you</i>, is above all
estimation. You are placed in the moral Thermopyl&aelig; of the world.
The evils arising from <i>alcohol</i> and <i>tobacco</i>, which you have it in your
power to avert from your country, are more dreadful than the invasion
of Xerxes with his millions. The cause of moral reform, in
the use of the latter of these articles, which we urge upon you with
deepest and sincerest solicitude, is far more urgent than that in which
the Bruti and the Gracchi offered up their lives. Some of you have
not yet handled or tasted the fatal drug. Let all such stand firm
henceforward, and never yield to the power of custom, temptation
and lust. Some of you, on the other hand, have permitted yourselves
to become the victims of this drug. Let all such be urged
by the voice of patriotism, religion, self-respect, reason, conscience,
and duty, to <i>abstain</i> from this poison, <i>immediately</i>, <i>entirely</i>, and <i>forever</i>.
And then every young man, and every young woman, in the
republic, shall be free from all the calamities attending the use of
this narcotic; and love, and peace, and joy, will run through the
land, and flow over the world. We put the question to every
youth: <span class="appeal"><i>will you do it</i>?</span></p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to the <i>friends of temperance</i>.</span> You have enlisted your energies
to expel intoxicating drinks from common use throughout the
world. Go on, and prosper. But, as you go, remember, that complete
success will not crown your exertions unless you are consistent,&mdash;unless
you abandon all use of tobacco, the companion and sister
of alcohol. As you go forth to the noble work you have undertaken,
you will be met at every corner, with the declaration of A. B.
and C., <i>I</i> am ready to abstain from alcohol when <i>you</i> do from tobacco;
and how effectually will this declaration shut your mouth, and
destroy your influence. Be <i>consistent</i>. Carry your principles into
<i>all</i> your evil habits, and a moral potency will be diffused through
what you say and do, that nothing can resist. We put the question
to every friend of temperance: <span class="appeal"><i>will you do it</i>?</span></p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to American <i>females</i>.</span> As mothers, wives and daughters,
you have it in your power (without turning aside from your appropriate
duties) to put an end to the use of this disgusting weed. The
children and youth of this nation, to say nothing of the young men
and fathers, are almost exclusively under your control; and may be
moulded at your pleasure. You know how <i>filthy</i>, <i>disgusting</i>, <i>ruinous</i>,
is the practice against which we ask you to set your faces. Only
practice ENTIRE ABSTINENCE yourselves, and urge this
practice upon all within your reach; and in less than twenty years,<!-- Page 27 --><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
this reformation will be completed. We put the question to every
mother, wife, daughter: <span class="appeal"><i>will you do it</i>?</span></p>

<p><span class="appeal">I appeal to the <i>medical</i> profession.</span> You are the guardians of the
health of the republic. You are acquainted with the deadly properties
of the drug in question. You can understand the necessity, and
appreciate the importance of reform. You know that <i>entire abstinence</i>
is urged by paramount considerations. In the work of reform
from spirit-drinking, you have acted in a manner that reflects honor
upon your profession. In the work of reform now urged upon your
notice, we calculate upon your active, hearty co-operation. If you
put your hand to this work, by <i>precept</i>, and by <i>example</i>; if you abstain
<i>entirely</i>, and <i>forever</i>, from all use of this plant, and inculcate
entire abstinence, as you have opportunity; the work which now
bespeaks your attention will soon be done. We put the question to
every medical man: <span class="appeal"><i>will you do it</i>?</span></p>

<p><span class="appeal">Finally&mdash;I appeal to <i>ministers</i> of the Gospel.</span> You are stationed
on the watch-towers of Zion, as guardians of the public morals.
Against every abomination your great Master requires you to cry
aloud and spare not; to lift up your voice like a trumpet; to show
the people their transgressions, and the house of Jacob their sins.
He requires you to be <i>examples</i> to the flock, in all things, that, while</p>

<p class="center" style="font-size:90%">"You allure to brighter worlds,"</p>

<p>you "may lead the way." I ask you to look at the influence of tobacco
upon the <i>health</i>, <i>wealth</i>, <i>morals</i>, and <i>lives</i> of this republic; and
then to decide, as in the fear of God, whether the blood of souls may
not be found on your garments, if you do not <i>abstain</i> yourselves
from all common use of this drug, and warn every man around you
to do likewise.<a name="FNanchor_E_5" id="FNanchor_E_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_E_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a> Suffer us to point you to Him who went about doing
good, and pleased not himself, and set a pure and perfect example in
everything; and also to that early servant of his, who would abstain
from things good and lawful, rather than prejudice the interests of
Zion. What reception would the Apostles have met, when they
went about to enlighten and reform the world, if they had carried
with them their <i>snuff-boxes</i>, <i>pipes</i>, <i>cigars</i>, and <i>pig-tail</i> tobacco? But
a word to the wise is sufficient. Let all who minister in holy things,
abstain from this poison, immediately, entirely, and forever; and
let them use the whole weight of their influence, and example, to
persuade others&mdash;and especially our youth&mdash;to practice entire abstinence;
and this good work will soon be done. We put the question
to every minister of Christ: <span class="appeal"><i>will you do it</i>?</span></p>

<p>I have read a pamphlet entitled "<span class="smcap">Facts</span>, etc., from <span class="smcap">Distinguished
Physicians and Other Sources</span>," respecting a vice which is undermining
the health and happiness of many, and degrading them, in
some respects, below the brute creation.</p>

<p>I think there is nothing in the manner of this pamphlet which can
be matter of just offence to any considerate mind. I am persuaded,
that, delicate as the task may be, the time has come when benevolence
demands that some effort should be made to enlighten the public
mind on the subject of which this pamphlet treats; and both the
remarks of the pamphlet, and the facts stated in it, seem to be well
adapted for this purpose. Most heartily do I wish success to that
benevolence which is willing to undertake a task so delicate and so
difficult as this.</p>

<p>It is time for those who love the purity, the well-being and the
most interesting relations of human society, to speak out upon a vice
which is dangerous in proportion to the secrecy and silence in
which it has been involved.</p>

<p class="rightsig"><span class="smcap">Amherst College</span>, April 17, 1842.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rev. Orin Fowler</span>:&mdash;Rev. and Dear Sir&mdash;I thank you heartily for your
pamphlet, on the use of that vile narcotic, <i>tobacco</i>. It ought to be the abhorring
of all mankind, as it is of all other flesh; and the extensive circulation
of your timely and powerful antidote, cannot fail of doing great good. The
public in general have no idea of the enormous expense of smoking and
chewing in this country; much less of the waste of health and life occasioned
by it. I rejoice that your essay begins to be loudly called for, and wish that
as many copies might be circulated as there are miserable slaves to the habit,
which, next to alcoholic drinking, is stupefying more brains, and probably
shortening more lives than any other.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Providence</span>, April 30, 1842.</p>

<p>I have read with interest the Rev. Orin Fowler's Essay on the evils of the
use of Tobacco. A perusal cannot fail to convince every candid mind. The
use of tobacco in most cases is an evil. The subject is ably discussed in this
essay. The arguments are sound, the facts abundant, and the conclusions
fair and forcible. They who can resist such appeals must be slaves indeed.
I shall rejoice in its wide circulation.</p>

<p class="center"><i>From Edward C. Delevan</i>.</p>

<p>E. C. Delevan, former Secretary of the New York State Temperance Society,
says, in a letter to the author&mdash;"The subject of your Essay is one of
immense importance to the world and to the temperance cause. The use of this
vile weed has been the medium of forming the appetite for strong drink, and
ultimately destroying thousands of the most promising youth of our country.
You will hardly ever meet with an intemperate person without finding him
addicted to the use of tobacco. The public only want light on this important
subject, to act. Your able and convincing Disquisition will be the means of
doing much good. I hope funds will be provided to furnish a copy to each
clergyman in the United States. Send me one thousand copies of the second
edition, as soon as it is from the press."</p>
